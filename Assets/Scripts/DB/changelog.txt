# BUG HUNT: PROJECT CHANGELOG & MANIFEST
# Project: Bug Hunt - Debug or Die Trying
# Maintainer: AMARO - FULL STACK DEVELOPER

===================================================================
[2026-01-14] - ARCHITECTURE & FOUNDATION UPDATE
===================================================================

### 1. NEW FILES ADDED
-------------------------------------------------------------------
(+) /Scripts/Architecture/DataBlueprint.cs
    - PURPOSE: The "Contract" between Frontend and Backend.
    - DETAILS: Contains the C# classes for PlayerStats, VirusConfig, and Economy.
    - NOTE: Do not attach this to a GameObject yet; it is a reference library. REF ONLY

(+) /Database/FirestoreStructure.json
    - PURPOSE: Visual guide for the NoSQL database setup.
    - DETAILS: Defines the 'users', 'game_config', and 'transactions' collections.

(+) /Scripts/Utils/AspectRatioEnforcer.cs
    - PURPOSE: Forces the game window to 16:9 to prevent UI breaking on ultrawide monitors.
    - LOGIC: Adds letterboxing (black bars) if the screen doesn't match target aspect.

(+) /Scripts/Managers/GameDataManager.cs
    - PURPOSE: Singleton to hold user session data across scenes.
    - UPDATE: Prepared for Google SSO integration and future DataBlueprint merging.


### 2. DEVELOPER RESPONSIBILITY MANIFEST
(Who should look at what?)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

>>> FRONTEND DEVELOPER (Unity / UI / Gameplay)
    [LOOK AT THESE FILES]:
    1. Scripts/Architecture/DataBlueprint.cs
       - Why: Use the variable names here (e.g., 'coins', 'gems') when binding your UI text. 
       - > PS YOU CAN ALSO CHANGE THE VARIABLE NAMES IF NEEDED.
       - Why: Use 'VirusConfig' to set up the Enemy AI variables (Speed, Aggression).
    
    2. Scripts/Utils/AspectRatioEnforcer.cs
       - Why: Ensure this script is in the very first scene (Splash/Login) to fix the camera bounds.

    3. Scripts/Managers/GameDataManager.cs
       - Why: Use 'GameDataManager.Instance.CurrentUser' to check if the player is logged in.

>>> BACKEND DEVELOPER (Firebase / API / Database)
    [LOOK AT THESE FILES]:
    1. Database/FirestoreStructure.json
       - Why: Create your Firestore Collections exactly as shown here.
       - Why: Set up the 'game_config' collection immediately so we can tweak game difficulty remotely.

    2. Scripts/Architecture/DataBlueprint.cs
       - Why: Your Cloud Functions must return JSON that matches these C# classes. 
       - Why: The 'TransactionRequest' class shows what data Unity will send you for Maya/PayPal.

    3. Documents/ERD_Diagram.mermaid
       - Why: Understand the relational logic between Users, Inventory, and Transactions.
